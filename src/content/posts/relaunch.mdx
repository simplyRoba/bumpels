After a _long_ weekend with :coffee: and a lot of free time (in corona times :mask:) i managed to migrate nearly all pages from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">jekyll</a> to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org" target="_blank">gatsby</a>. The home of the Bumpels frontend is now powered completly by <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>.

The old _news_ site got a new name and a complete design rework. Try it your self <Link to="/blog">here</Link>.

The <Link to="/gallery">Gallery</Link> is still under construction, but the result will be awesome :sunglasses:.

With the new technology under the hood, there are plenty of new possibilites and i have a lot of ideas. _Stay excited!_

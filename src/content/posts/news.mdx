Today the new news page just launched.It uses <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/" target="_blank">Bootstrapâ€™s cards feature</a> to show the articles. Also it can handle title images, which i will use in the future.

The next feature i will work on is the gallery. I already have some nice ideas to show more Bumpels.

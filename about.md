### .. the Bumpels

Hi, we are the Bumpels.
We just started to grow. Just follow our creator if you do not want to miss anything.

### .. the Creator

My name is Axel Rojas Bachem or _simply roba_. I created the Bumpels in a "free" minute and took it as pretext, to learn about some technologies like [Jekyll][1], [Bootstrap v4][2] and vector graphics with [Affinity Designer][3]. You find the repository [here][4].

This page will grow everytime i find _time_ for it.

Feel free to _share_ and use the Bumpels! Just respect the **licenses** you can find in the footer.
